Ranked Choice Voting -- R Package
=================================

`rcv` helps you work directly with raw ballot image and cast vote record data to run elections.

Features: \* Read in ballot image and master lookup files \* Merge these files to get a "readable" ballot layout \* Conduct elections, and view a round-by-round table of results

The style of this README is inspired by the [googlesheets](%22github.com/jennybc/googlesheets%22) R package.

You can install the development version of `rcv`:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ds-elections/rcv")
```
