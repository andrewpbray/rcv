# Ranked Choice Voting -- R Package

`rcv` helps you work directly with raw ballot image data to run elections.

Features:
* Read in ballot image and master lookup files
* Merge these files to get a "readable" ballot layout
* Conduct elections, and view a round-by-round table of results

The style of this README is inspired by the [googlesheets]("github.com/jennybc/googlesheets") R package.

You can install the development version of `rcv`:

> `devtools::install_github("ds-elections/rcv")`

## Basic Workflow Demo

Put stuff here later talking about how to use the functions
